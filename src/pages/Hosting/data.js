Node.js is used to construct backend (server-side) code, whereas react is a frontend (client-side) library. While both are JavaScript technologies, no direct comparison exists between the two. These technologies are often part of the same project. In fact, the greatest advantage of learning both technologies is that you can work server-side and client-side using the same programming language - JavaScript.",

It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components. React implements a virtual DOM that is basically a DOM tree representation in JavaScript. So when it needs to read or write to the DOM,it will use the virtual representation of it. Then the virtual DOM will find the most efektive way to the browser. ",
